#string is a built-in module/library that contains some constants, utility function, and classes for string manipulation. We have to import it before using any of its constants and classes. 

#text_list is our new variable. We are taking the 'text' from our reader and using the split() method to split our string into a list. The default separator for split is whitespace, but you can define a different one.

#string.punctuation is a constant that provides a list of punctuation

#maketrans creates an empty mapping table. The third argument lists all the characters to remove during the translation process

----STOP words
we need to go over each word in our text file and check if it's on our STOP_WORDS list
if it is on our STOP_WORDS list, that word needs to be excluded
if it's not in our STOP WORDS list, that word needs to go into a new list

#we need an empty array to hold the words we do want


----go through the file word by word and keep a count of how often each word is used

we need to go through our list
we need to record all words that are being used for the first time
and put them in a list
those words would be 'new' or new list
we need to record all words that are being repeated and how many times

we need to go through our list
we need to record all words that are being used for the first time
those words are new
we need to record all words that are being repeated
those are old
we need to add new words to old words
we need to know the sum of new words and old words to know the final count

---

we want to take the value of the count
and append the number of asterisks equal to the value of the count
