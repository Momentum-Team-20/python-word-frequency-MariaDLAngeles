#string is a built-in module/library that contains some constants, utility function, and classes for string manipulation. We have to import it before using any of its constants and classes. 

#text_list is our new variable. We are taking the 'text' from our reader and using the split() method to split our string into a list. The default separator for split is whitespace, but you can define a different one.

#string.punctuation is a constant that provides a list of punctuation

#maketrans creates an empty mapping table. The third argument lists all the characters to remove during the translation process

----STOP words
we need to go over each word in our text file and check if it's on our STOP_WORDS list
if it is on our STOP_WORDS list, that word needs to be excluded
if it's not in our STOP WORDS list, that word needs to go into a new list

#we need an empty array to hold the words we do want
